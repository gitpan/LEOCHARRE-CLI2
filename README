LEOCHARRE::CLI2
===============================================

Some quick help for writing cli scripts.
Forces by default that -h triggers help, that -d triggers debug, and -v version..
Automates help, debug, version etc.
If you use LEOCHARRE::CLI2, we alter the OPTIONS automatically.
Also we automatically generate HELP.
